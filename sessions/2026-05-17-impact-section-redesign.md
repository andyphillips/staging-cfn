# Session — 2026-05-17 — Impact section redesign & hero sizing

## Summary

Polished the homepage Impact section ("Impact designed to endure"), tweaked
sub-page hero heights at the widest breakpoint, and grew the "From the field"
story card images. Two commits pushed to `main`.

## Changes

### 1. Image sizing tweaks (`styles.css`)

- `.feature-image-block` min-heights bumped ~20% across breakpoints
  - mobile: 280 → **336px**
  - tablet (≥640px): 340 → **408px**
  - desktop (≥1024px): 420 → **504px**
- `.split-feature-img` min-height: 280 → **336px**
- `.story-item-img` (homepage "From the field" cards): 200 → **240px**
- `.programme-card-img`: 200 → **240px**

### 2. Sub-page hero on widest breakpoint (`styles.css`)

Added a `.page-hero` override inside `@media (min-width: 1280px)` so all
sub-page heroes share the same, taller hero on large screens:

```css
.page-hero { padding: 220px 60px 120px; height: 634px; }
```

(480 → 576 → 634px = +20% then +10%.)

### 3. Homepage Impact section redesign (`index.html` + `styles.css`)

Replaced the plain stat row with a full-bleed visual band.

**Final state:**

- Banner photo: `AI_images/sea_turtle_underwater_coral_reef_ACE.jpeg`
- Overlay: `linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(14,110,117,0.85) 0%, rgba(17,17,17,0.85) 100%)`
  (matches the Project MITHI immersive band — teal → charcoal at 85%)
- "Our Impact" section label above the heading
- Glassy translucent stat cards (`rgba(255,255,255,0.12)` + backdrop-blur + subtle white border)
- White heading/lead text with soft text-shadows for readability
- `.highlight` "endure" word styled as brand teal (`var(--teal)`)
- **No icons** on the cards
- "1000s Members Engaged" → "1000s **People Engaged**"

**Iterations during the session (in order):**

1. Mangrove "above/below water" photo + teal gradient overlay + emoji icons → rejected
2. Filipino fisherman sunset + neutral dark overlay, icons removed
3. Underwater reef photo, overlay removed entirely → text hard to read
4. Soft teal gradient wash (0.55 / 0.35) → too light
5. Muted teal gradient (0.78 / 0.6), highlight switched to white
6. Final: matched MITHI band overlay (0.85 / 0.85 teal → charcoal), highlight reverted to teal

### 4. Copy fix (`work-and-impact.html`)

- "Members Engaged" → "People Engaged"

## Commits pushed

- `ed07837` — Redesign homepage Impact section with underwater banner; copy + sizing tweaks
- `86731f7` — Revert impact 'endure' highlight to brand teal

Both pushed to `origin/main`.

## Files touched

- `index.html`
- `work-and-impact.html`
- `styles.css`

## Post-session housekeeping (directory restructure)

After the user reorganised the working tree, an audit + fix-up was performed:

**Directory moves (done by user):**
- `AI_images/` → `library/ai_generated_images/`
- `images/` → `library/old_images/`
- `figma/` → `library/figma/`
- `newImages/` → `library/new_images/`
- `option-*.html` → `options/`

**Broken-link fixes applied:**
- All active root HTML pages: `AI_images/` → `library/ai_generated_images/`
  (about, contact, donate, get-involved, index, programme-mithi, programmes,
  stories, story-mithi, work-and-impact + dev-only homepage-content, index-old)
- `index-old.html`: `images/hero.jpg` → `library/old_images/hero.jpg`; bare
  `logo.png` → `library/unused_root/logo.png`
- `options/option-d-animated.html`: `hero-ocean.mp4` → `../assets/hero-ocean.mp4`

**Unused root assets moved to `library/unused_root/`:**
- `Homepage.jpg` (duplicate of `library/figma/Homepage.jpg`)
- `hero_bg.jpg`
- `logo.png` (different/older file than `assets/logo.png`; only referenced by
  gitignored `index-old.html`)
- `logo_raw.png`
- `nav_preview.png`

**`.gitignore` refreshed:** removed obsolete root-level entries
(`newImages/`, `images/`, `figma/`, root image paths); added new local-only
library subfolders (`library/old_images/`, `library/new_images/`,
`library/figma/`, `library/unused_root/`) and `options/`. The published
`library/ai_generated_images/` remains tracked.

**Final audit:** 0 broken links across the live site and dev archives
(29 OK refs; remote Pexels/Unsplash URLs assumed valid).
